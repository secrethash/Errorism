Installation is just a piece of cake if all the above requirements are met correctly. So, thinking that the above requirements are met successfully, I am starting the Installation procedure. IF you want any help, you can contact me any-time [at] contact@shashwat.cf


(1). Open ercnfg.php file and edit the variables as per your website requirements.
	(a) -> Remember to not change anything if you do not know what you are doing.

(2). Copy all the files, after extracting from zip, to your server via. FTP(File Transfer Protocol).
('!') Do not Copy the .htaccess file if already present in the server as it can overwrite the old one that any other script/software is using. You can loose the configuration of the old software.
	(a) -> Errorism is designed by keeping in mind that it fits correctly with any other PHP Software, that is why all it's directories have different name either starting with 'er-', 'er' or ending with 'er'.

(3). If the .htaccess file is already present in the server then skip it and copy the other files. You will need to edit the .htaccess file afterwards.

(4). After copying the files, if you have also copied the .htaccess file in your server due to it's absence then skip the below steps and Jump directly to 'STEP 9' and please also read the note below.

(5). Now as we see that you already have a software that is using .htaccess file, you need to open the .htaccess file that you already had on your server with your favourite text editor.

(6). Find the below line in it:

	"ErrorDocument"

if not present skip to step 8, simply.

(7). If present, delete the full statements like:

ErrorDocument 404 /404.php

Delete the above statement. Like this there could be more statements for 403, 503 and other errors, Delete Them!

(8). Copy the text in your .htaccess file present in your p.c., the file that you skipped before in Step 3, and paste it in the .htaccess file present in your server.

(9). Installation Finished! Be Updated to our Errorism Script. For checking the latest version of our software go to Errorism Control Panel situated at 'www.yoursite.com/erpanel/' and login with your Admin credentials that you've set in the configuration file 'ercnfg.php'.

(10). Bravo!!! Enjoy this free-ware software. Installation Finished!! Please do not Hesitate to contact us.
